GPS Simulator Web Interface Test Script

This script tests the web interface of the GPS simulator, including:
- Status checking
- Starting/stopping simulation
- CSV file upload

Requirements:
- Python 3.6+
- requests: pip install requests

Usage:
    python test_web_interface.py <device_ip>
    
Example:
    python test_web_interface.py 192.168.1.100
